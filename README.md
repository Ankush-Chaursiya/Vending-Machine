# Vending-Machine
I designed and implemented a vending machine using Verilog HDL on ISE Xilinx software. The vending machine accepts 5Rs and 10Rs coins as inputs and dispenses a 15Rs water bottle as an output.
Additionally, it provides any necessary coin change as an output if more than 15Rs are entered. The design was based on a Finite State Machine (FSM).
Ex - input as a 5rs and a 10rs coin and gives the one output i.e 15rs water bottle and machine also gives change for example if 10+10 rs is given then the machine will give change
of 5rs.
