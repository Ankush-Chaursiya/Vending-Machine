# Vending-Machine
I have designed a vending machine that taken input as a 5rs and a 10rs coin and gives the one output i.e 15rs water bottle and machine also gives change for example if 10+10 rs is given then machine will give change
of 5rs and implemented this using verilog on ISE xilinx software.
